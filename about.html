    <h1>About the Developer</h1>

    <p>
      My name is Joshua Selvidge, and I'm a cybersecurity engineer by trade with over a decade of experience in offensive and defensive security, red teaming, and infrastructure design. I’ve worked across DOD, Oil & Gas, and startup environments — and I’m passionate about learning and building.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project began as a personal challenge: to learn game engine internals and shader programming by modernizing one of my favorite games — <strong>Command & Conquer: Generals Zero Hour</strong>. What started as an investigation into DX8 has evolved into a full modernization effort and the groundwork for a total overhaul mod inspired by modern military doctrine and real-world drone warfare.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goals with this project are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rebuild and modernize the original game engine with working shader and rendering backends (BGFX)</li>
      <li>Replace deprecated and proprietary dependencies with open-source or modern alternatives</li>
      <li>Lay the foundation for a fully rebuilt mod that imagines a modern, geopolitically aware C&C experience</li>
      <li>Open this work to the community to contribute, test, and iterate on</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is an open, passion-driven project. If you’re into C&C, game dev, shaders, or security engineering — you’re welcome here.
